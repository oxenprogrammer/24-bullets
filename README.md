## Game Design (GDD)

### Main goal

> To develop a top down shooter game in which the shooter eliminates hit-men as they approach him, in the process collecting as many points as possible thus competing to be among the top 5 players. 

### The original idea

> What's the story behind hitman?

My father was an Army general back in the days. As a young boy, he always bought me toy soldiers, and at 14, when I watched the hitman movie in 2007, I fell in live with it.
I decided to develop this game for my nephew as a cheap alternative to 3D games on the console while at the same time improving upon my JavaScript Skill and knowledge using in a fun interactive way.

### Gather and prepare the assets

I made a list of all the assets I would require:
- A background and logo images
- A tile to use as platform
- Images for the player, bullets and enemies
- A hitman sound track plus gun shots, and falling bullet shells.
- Buttons and checkboxes

I looked for assets in open source art websites, such as [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org/)

### Development stage

#### 1. Set the Required Scenes and Assets

I first added most of the required game assets. 
Since the game requires different scenes for eloquent organization and reusability, I set up the Boot, Preloader, Game, Title, Credit, and Option Scenes.


#### 2. Add the player

First, I designed the player, gave him the right size and physic mechanics like movement.
I then added firing of the bullets.

#### 3. Add Enemies

- Added enemies in form of hitmen and spawned them down the game scene.
- Added the ability of the enemies to fire bullets as well.

#### 4. Add Collision impact

- Added shooter bullet and enemy collision.
- Added shooter bullet and enemy bullet collision.
- Added shooter and enemy bullet collision.
- Added shooter and enemy collision.
All of which either leads to the shooter dying or the enemies.

#### 5. Implement a scoring system

Used the external API to get and post scores by players. 

#### 6. Manuel Testing
Played the game with my nephew. Then changed the game soundtrack plus shooting sounds to make it feel more like a hitman game.

#### 7. Unit Testing
Used Jest to test the External API plus the DOM manipulation.

### Deployment

- Deployed on gh-pages.
